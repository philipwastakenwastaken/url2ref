## Motivation

Manually citing a news article on the web in a thorough manner can be a tedious process. To do so, one has to write down the title, authors, publication date, work and other attributes. While there exists tools for converting a collection of attributes into a specific reference style, the manual collection of those attributes typically remains a chore. However, this application aims to make this process automatic for some web resources, namely those which have structured and annotated their content according to a semantic web format, such as [Microdata](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Microdata), [RDFa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa) or [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), using the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) vocabulary.

## Front end

The application [has a web front end](https://url2ref.onrender.com/) hosted by [Render](https://render.com), making it easy to retrieve a reference simply by pasting a URL into the query field.
